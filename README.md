This project demonstrates how to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary using machine learning techniques. We use a TF-IDF vectorizer to transform text data into numerical features, followed by training a Logistic Regression model to classify movie genres. The model is evaluated using accuracy and can also make predictions for new plot summaries.

Description
In this project, we train a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie given a plot summary. The process includes:

Data Preprocessing: Splitting movie plot and genre data into training and testing sets.
Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert textual data into numerical format.
Model Training: Applying Logistic Regression for genre classification.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model’s performance using accuracy score.
Prediction: Predicting the genre for a new movie plot.
The genres are classified as one of the following:

Adventure
Family
Horror
Romance
Sci-Fi
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-genre-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd movie-genre-prediction
Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the model, simply execute the script:

bash
Copy
python movie_genre_prediction.py
The script will print the model’s accuracy on the test set, and show a prediction for a new movie plot summary.

You can replace the sample movie plot with your own plot to get genre predictions for new movies.
